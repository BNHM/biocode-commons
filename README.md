# biocode-commons
The space between standards and software, standards and other standards, and between software and other software, 
is what we are calling the "commons". Hence, the "Biocode Commons" specifically addresses the gap present 
in the biodiversity genomics community between collections based data (commonly museum specimens and tissues) 
and the sequence based data sets.

This code repository contains files directly pertaining to the Biocode Commons.
